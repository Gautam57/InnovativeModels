      "I watched your video with interest as the thumb-nail is a click bait one. You have become the mouthpiece of Dr. Raghuram Rajan, the eternal pessimist and a virulent critic of the present government, after he could not get his extension as RBI Governor for the second time. You have compared China's growth with India, as belittling as speed of the goods train. You have selectively cut and pasted the interviews and news items of many of the hallowed persons. I need to answer your slurry. In 70’s, USA with her President Nixon and the Aide Henry Kissinger embarked to China who they have considered China as a possible ally to break the hold of USSR from the world order. The MNCs looking for instant profit fell into the trap of Mao Ze Dong and opened their manufacturing bases. In business there is no Capitalism or Communism, only the haves and have-nots. The great Steve Jobs visited India and he chose China over India. Elon Musk started his Tesla in Shanghai with a clear understanding that the technology transfer is for Chinese only. They as usual, stripped his technology and made BYD as the arch rival to Tesla. He has not flown his Space X from China. You are comparing Vietnamese speed of getting the relocated projects from China. The Chinese Barons who run away with their money moved to Vietnam along with their Companies, they hold. Ratan Tata himself had said that when Tata Nano wanted to shift their project from Singur, Bengal to Sanand Gujarat in 2008, the then Chief Minister Modi met him on the land allocated to Nano Project with red carpet. That type of instant decisions are possible, though it cannot be a rule.  Make in India may not be grand success as many variables have chipped in after the announcement of that Program. Covid, Slow-down of world economy, Constant bickering at the border with the neighbouring countries exacerbated by anti-Indian activity by the so-called Leftists and Intellectuals to cite a few. Even with all the shortcomings it is taking shape. Even for a totalitarian country like China, it has taken many decades with a lot of help from USA. You can follow the link https://www.pppinindia.gov.in/list_of_all_ppp_projects where as many as 1583 projects with an outlay of nearly Rs.25 lakh crores been invested. Many projects may be under Make in India scheme. India, time immemorial is an Agriculture based economy like China. When the transition came China, due to its stroke of luck became a manufacturing economy. India straightway became a service economy thanks to technological boom in the West and more English-speaking employees available in our Country. Now we are taking a step backward to integrate manufacturing into services with lot of hiccups.  Two or three decades is merely a blip in a country’s growth. I expect a pat for the development of our country showing the highlights of various achievements. Every goal always be not perfect. Graphs and Histograms do not reveal the true nature of economy.

      "The \"Make in India\" initiative, launched with the aim of turning India into a global manufacturing hub, has faced numerous significant challenges and is widely seen as having fallen short of its ambitious goals. Below are various ways in which the initiative has struggled, with many viewing it as more of a political slogan than a functional strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unrealistic Manufacturing Targets\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial Target: The initiative aimed to increase the manufacturing sector's share of GDP to 25% by 2022 from about 16% in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: As of recent years, the manufacturing sector has barely crossed the 17% mark, far short of the target. With a lack of structural reforms and coherent planning, this goal was likely unachievable from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lack of Infrastructure Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: Manufacturing requires strong infrastructure, including reliable power, transport, and logistics networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: Infrastructure bottlenecks have persisted, with delayed projects, inadequate facilities, and power supply issues that drive up costs and make Indian manufacturing less competitive globally. For instance, logistics costs in India are about 14% of GDP, much higher than global benchmarks of 8-9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Complex Regulatory Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Bureaucratic Red Tape: Although the government promoted \"ease of doing business,\" many regulatory processes remained complex, lengthy, and inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Reforms: Essential reforms needed to streamline business approvals, land acquisition, and labor laws were either delayed or implemented in a way that was insufficient to attract major foreign investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Failure to Attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "High Expectations: The initiative hoped to bring in significant foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortfall: While FDI has increased in service sectors, manufacturing FDI has lagged due to concerns about poor infrastructure, regulatory unpredictability, and high labor costs. Many international companies chose countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh over India due to more favorable conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lack of Skill Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue: The \"Make in India\" initiative required a skilled workforce capable of meeting the demands of advanced manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: India's vocational training and skill development programs have not been able to keep pace with industry demands. This has resulted in a skills gap, forcing companies to either compromise on quality or look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Dependence on Imports\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: To manufacture goods domestically, the Indian industry needs access to quality raw materials and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: India has continued to rely heavily on imports for critical raw materials, machinery, and components, especially from China, undercutting the core aim of the initiative to reduce imports and increase self-sufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Inadequate Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Role of SMEs: SMEs are critical to any manufacturing ecosystem, but many Indian SMEs lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Without adequate support and funding, SMEs have struggled to contribute meaningfully to the \"Make in India\" mission. Bureaucratic hurdles and delayed payments further exacerbate their problems, leading to high mortality rates among SMEs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. High Operating Costs and Lack of Competitive Edge\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating Costs: Energy, labor, and logistics costs in India are significantly higher compared to countries like China and Vietnam, making Indian goods less competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Indian manufacturing struggles to compete on the global stage, with \"Make in India\" unable to address the core cost and efficiency issues that deter international buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Limited Success in Job Creation\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal: The initiative intended to create millions of new jobs, especially in manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",

      "The \"Make in India\" initiative’s failures stem from a mix of ambitious but unrealistic targets, a complex business environment, and a lack of deep-rooted reforms in infrastructure, labor, and skill development. These factors have kept India’s manufacturing sector from realizing its potential, and until structural changes are made, the initiative may remain more a symbol of aspiration than actual progress.  -----  Criticism\n",

I very well agree that we do have Land Acquisition and environmental clearance issues in pushing projects ahead. But aren't environmental issues for real. If you compare India with the State of environment in Vietnam today, you will find that rampant development and industry has spoilt Vietnam's environment very fast. As fast as that country has grown, its environment has been harmed that quickly. India has been developing since 1947, while Vietnam has started growing much recently. But with their rapid growth, the environment too has deteriorated as much. Do we want to go that route. Essentially, faster environmental clearances means , overlooking any serious issues that could happen. Any industry is only going to cut down trees, release effluents , and cause pollution. To make industrialists stop that means asking them to take measures which definitely increase running costs which they will never agree too. That's why the state of rivers in India is bad today. \n",

      "The caste system and a weak central government are the most important problems to be solved. Class discrimination in India makes it impossible for the government to effectively use every people. When India became independent, it did not establish the country by force as China did. When it was founded, too many \"elites\" who received foreign education returned to the country to rule. Most local leaders who had cooperated with the British during the British colonial period directly became government officials, who only thought about their own rights and wealth. This led to India being formed by a group of small kingdoms. The central government could not issue its own decrees better. It is hard to imagine that today, when science was known in 2024, people's lives would be better, It is unbelievable that many people in India still go to temples to pray that they will become richer in this or the next life  -----  Critique\n",

You have become the mouthpiece of Dr. Raghuram Rajan, the eternal pessimist and a virulent critic of the present government, after he could not get his extension as RBI Governor for the second time. You have compared China's growth with India, as belittling as speed of the goods train. You have selectively cut and pasted the interviews and news items of many of the hallowed persons. I need to answer your slurry. In 70’s, USA with her President Nixon and the Aide Henry Kissinger embarked to China who they have considered China as a possible ally to break the hold of USSR from the world order. The MNCs looking for instant profit fell into the trap of Mao Ze Dong and opened their manufacturing bases. In business there is no Capitalism or Communism, only the haves and have-nots. The great Steve Jobs visited India and he chose China over India. Elon Musk started his Tesla in Shanghai with a clear understanding that the technology transfer is for Chinese only. They as usual, stripped his technology and made BYD as the arch rival to Tesla. He has not flown his Space X from China. You are comparing Vietnamese speed of getting the relocated projects from China. The Chinese Barons who run away with their money moved to Vietnam along with their Companies, they hold. Ratan Tata himself had said that when Tata Nano wanted to shift their project from Singur, Bengal to Sanand Gujarat in 2008, the then Chief Minister Modi met him on the land allocated to Nano Project with red carpet. That type of instant decisions are possible, though it cannot be a rule. Make in India may not be grand success as many variables have chipped in after the announcement of that Program. Covid, Slow-down of world economy, Constant bickering at the border with the neighboring countries exacerbated by anti-Indian activity by the so-called Leftists and Intellectuals to cite a few. Even with all the shortcomings it is taking a shape. Even for a totalitarian country like China, it has taken many decades with a lot of help from USA. You can follow the link https://www.pppinindia.gov.in/list_of_all_ppp_projects where as many as 1583 projects with an outlay of nearly Rs.25 lakh crores been invested. Many projects may be under Make in India scheme. India, time immemorial is an Agriculture based economy like China. When the transition came China, due to its stroke of luck became a manufacturing economy. India straightway became a service economy thanks to technological boom in the West and more English-speaking employees available in our Country. Now we are taking a step backward to integrate manufacturing into services with lot of hiccups.  Two or three decades is merely a blip in a country’s growth. I expect a pat for the development of our country showing the highlights of various achievements. Every goal always be not perfect. Graphs and Histograms do not reveal the true nature of economy.

Because of these reasons the land owners file court cases against the government which stalls the speed of progress. Eventhough we say that Chinese government is a dictatorship but whenever they want to acquire land from their own people they acquire is by paying them the market rate. If a person does not want to sell their land to the government because of any reason, the government moves their plans elsewhere or changes their plans accordingly to handle such problems.  -----  **Criticism**\n",

      "What ChatGpt says:\n",
      "Yes, India’s limited focus on manufacturing has had significant economic consequences, and this has become especially apparent over the past decade. Here are several ways in which it has impacted the country:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Low Job Creation\n",
      "\n",
      "India’s service sector-driven growth has not generated enough jobs, especially for the millions entering the workforce every year. Manufacturing, particularly in sectors like textiles, electronics, and automotive, can absorb large numbers of semi-skilled and skilled workers. The lack of a robust manufacturing base has limited employment opportunities, contributing to high youth unemployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dependence on Imports\n",
      "\n",
      "India relies heavily on imports for essential goods like electronics, defense equipment, machinery, and chemicals. For example, India imports a significant portion of its electronics and machinery from countries like China, making it vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions, price volatility, and trade imbalances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Trade Deficit and Foreign Exchange Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "With low domestic manufacturing output, India has struggled with a persistent trade deficit, impacting its foreign exchange reserves and currency stability. In times of economic uncertainty, a high trade deficit can increase inflation and reduce purchasing power.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Countries with a strong manufacturing sector tend to have higher investments in research and development, leading to technology advancements and innovation. India’s lag in manufacturing has meant that it has largely remained a consumer of global technology rather than a developer. This has slowed the progress of indigenous innovations, which are vital for self-sufficiency in sectors like electronics and green energy.\n",

      "A strong manufacturing base has been a key growth engine for many Asian economies, including China, South Korea, and Vietnam. Manufacturing tends to have higher productivity levels than services and agriculture, leading to stronger and more resilient GDP growth. India’s economy, by contrast, remains skewed towards services, which are often less resilient in downturns.\n",

Manufacturing hubs in rural or semi-urban areas create direct and indirect employment, develop infrastructure, and provide stable income sources for locals. Without manufacturing expansion, rural areas have remained largely dependent on agriculture, which is seasonal and highly vulnerable to climate and price fluctuations.\n",

Below are various ways in which the initiative has struggled, with many viewing it as more of a political slogan than a functional strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unrealistic Manufacturing Targets\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial Target: The initiative aimed to increase the manufacturing sector's share of GDP to 25% by 2022 from about 16% in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: As of recent years, the manufacturing sector has barely crossed the 17% mark, far short of the target. With a lack of structural reforms and coherent planning, this goal was likely unachievable from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lack of Infrastructure Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: Manufacturing requires strong infrastructure, including reliable power, transport, and logistics networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: Infrastructure bottlenecks have persisted, with delayed projects, inadequate facilities, and power supply issues that drive up costs and make Indian manufacturing less competitive globally. For instance, logistics costs in India are about 14% of GDP, much higher than global benchmarks of 8-9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Complex Regulatory Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Bureaucratic Red Tape: Although the government promoted \"ease of doing business,\" many regulatory processes remained complex, lengthy, and inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Reforms: Essential reforms needed to streamline business approvals, land acquisition, and labor laws were either delayed or implemented in a way that was insufficient to attract major foreign investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Failure to Attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "High Expectations: The initiative hoped to bring in significant foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortfall: While FDI has increased in service sectors, manufacturing FDI has lagged due to concerns about poor infrastructure, regulatory unpredictability, and high labor costs. Many international companies chose countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh over India due to more favorable conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lack of Skill Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue: The \"Make in India\" initiative required a skilled workforce capable of meeting the demands of advanced manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: India's vocational training and skill development programs have not been able to keep pace with industry demands. This has resulted in a skills gap, forcing companies to either compromise on quality or look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Dependence on Imports\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: To manufacture goods domestically, the Indian industry needs access to quality raw materials and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: India has continued to rely heavily on imports for critical raw materials, machinery, and components, especially from China, undercutting the core aim of the initiative to reduce imports and increase self-sufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Inadequate Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Role of SMEs: SMEs are critical to any manufacturing ecosystem, but many Indian SMEs lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Without adequate support and funding, SMEs have struggled to contribute meaningfully to the \"Make in India\" mission. Bureaucratic hurdles and delayed payments further exacerbate their problems, leading to high mortality rates among SMEs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. High Operating Costs and Lack of Competitive Edge\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating Costs: Energy, labor, and logistics costs in India are significantly higher compared to countries like China and Vietnam, making Indian goods less competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Indian manufacturing struggles to compete on the global stage, with \"Make in India\" unable to address the core cost and efficiency issues that deter international buyers.\n",

      "\n",
      "Goal: The initiative intended to create millions of new jobs, especially in manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: Job creation has remained weak, with a limited increase in manufacturing jobs and a large portion of employment still concentrated in the informal sector. This failure is a direct consequence of the slow growth of manufacturing and structural issues in job-intensive sectors.\n",

      "Impact: The pandemic disrupted global supply chains, impacting production and investment flows worldwide.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Make in India\" initiative’s failures stem from a mix of ambitious but unrealistic targets, a complex business environment, and a lack of deep-rooted reforms in infrastructure, labor, and skill development. These factors have kept India’s manufacturing sector from realizing its potential, and until structural changes are made, the initiative may remain more a symbol of aspiration than actual progress.  -----  Criticism\n",

Even as a small business, we pay our workers fairly, offer benefits, and treat them with kindness and respect. And yet, the biggest challenge we face is attrition. Even basic hygiene as showing up to work in time, informing before taking leaves, being diligent at work, feeling ambitious about your work, trying to up-skill yourself so you can move up the ladder, seem like too much to ask these days. I think where we differ very much from China is the respect for one's work. While we have high unemployment rates, it's appalling to me that almost everyone around me (we operate out of an Industrial area in Noida) is struggling to get good workforce. We don't even hire for specific skills, we believe in hiring the unskilled but willing and training them for the job, but we're honestly at end of our wits finding the right kind of talent.

      "1. The biggest part of land acquisition apart from lucrative trade-off costs is the fact that most land holders are farmers. And the thing is that most of them consider their land as their dearest or even God, whatever its size may be.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Another thing is that, most projects are usually set up on fertile places (even in fertile fish-rich waters in seas in case of fishermen). Now these fertile lands are not only a guranteer of self needs, but also are a healthy & comfort place for many that don't want a tiny piece of \"apartment\" in a congested city with some petty cash to be traded with the best lives they're living with.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one in their right mind would give away these things just for some companies to be set up for profiting their owners. Now, if you say that everyone's getting jobs, remember that when a business grows, the owners and upper tier officials get a huge chunk, but those actually working hard down the line, may merely see any salary hike, which is of no use as inflation is already gotten above till you get any hikes. Hence, land owners would rather never want to give away lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example is: Giving away lands is easily done in Gujarat as firstly the areas are relatively less fertile, especially in the northern & western part of the state, combined with the fact that ppl over there may do away with their lands with a good deal, while in fertile regions like in Maharashtra,  point 1 & 2 make it harder for land acquisitions. Hence, Land banks would eventually fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the best deal I see in such areas is long term lease of lands by govt. from the land owners, paying them anually or in brief periods, along with an agreement that whatever happens on the land may have minimal impact on them & environment as well and ensuring these conditions to implementation as well.  -----  **Critique**\n",

An environmentally unsustainable manufacturing industry is inherently unsustainable in the long term. As natural resources dwindle and pollution regulations become stricter, industries that rely on excessive resource consumption and harmful emissions face mounting operational and financial pressures. Public awareness and demand for eco-friendly products also drive shifts away from such practices, making it harder for unsustainable manufacturers to compete. Furthermore, the environmental damage they cause often leads to increased costs for cleanup and health impacts, undermining their profitability and viability. The examples of the nations quoted in this video are today facing massive environmental disasters due to  unbridled factories in their nations. In China, heavy industrial pollution has led to severe air and water contamination, exemplified by incidents like the 2005 Songhua River benzene spill, which affected millions by polluting drinking water supplies.

A recent joint monitoring programme (JMP) on water, sanitation and hygiene by the World Health Organization and UNICEF released July 1, 2021 stated that at least 15 per cent of the total population in India defecates in the open.\n",
      "2) \"Know your meme: India superpower by 2020\". They claimed in year 1998 that they will be superpower by 2020 or earlier? What happened today? GDP per capita not even 3k? Is that a definition of a superpower?\n",
      "3) India claimed to have landed on the \"South Pole\" of the Moon. What happened? Two out of the best 3 space agencies of the World (Russia/USA/China) said India did not land on Moon's South Pole. \n",
      "3A) NASA specifically said \"The Chandrayaan-3 landing site is located about 600 kilometers from the Moon’s South Pole.\". This is just another diplomatic way of saying India did not land on Moon's South Pole. If India had landed on on Moon's South Pole, NASA would have simply said that \"The Chandrayaan-3 landing site is located at the Moon’s South Pole\" instead of \"The Chandrayaan-3 landing site is located about 600 KILOMETERS FROM the Moon’s South Pole.\n",
      "3B) Dr Ouyang Ziyuan, lauded as the father of China’s lunar exploration programme, told the Chinese-language Science Times newspaper that the Chandrayaan-3 landing site, at 69 degrees south latitude, was nowhere close to the pole, defined as between 88.5 and 90 degrees.\n",
      "4) Indians claimed that Modi is the \"most popular Prime Minister/leader of the entire world\" ages ago before the most recent election of 2024 took place. What happened? He barely won. Under India’s electoral system, the party or alliance that wins more than 272 seats in the 543-member parliament can form a government. Opposition parties including the Indian National Congress won 235 seats. Modi merely won 238 seats. (ASTHA RAJVANSHI TIME).

Not even one single Indian Astronaunt was sent into space. \"The Indian Space Research Organization is planning to send astronauts to space before the year 2015-16, deputy project director of ISRO's Chandrayaan Mission Jaswinder Singh Khoral said in Chandigarh on Thursday. (Times of India).\" This is the statement made by India in year 2010.\n",

India has merely 55 companies in Forbes Global 2000 companies\" and all are not even top 10, not even top 20, not even top 30, not even top 40 but only ranked top 45 (Reliance Industries)? Meanwhile, another similar country in terms of population, China, has 3 of their companies in the top 10 ranking of \"Forbes Global 2000 companies\" and has 346 companies instead of only 55 companies in that same ranking list?

Do, you know without the Local government permission we can't even visit such places. Moreover, implementing any Central scheme also becomes difficult. Environmental concern?? Why not, emphasizing on getting a law or Policy regarding it?? It's already a Sensitive zone without the permission of the army & GOI u can't open anything there.  -----  Criticism\n",

Here the ration and rate is important because if the population has grown imports needed may also be more. for example take the consumption of crude OIL  2004-2014 get the rate and ration with population and same compare it now. (u can also add $$ values if needed because prices may be different) this i am saying because Crude is the biggest part of our Imports and even the $$ to rupee is changed a lot so imports this decade can be normalized as compared to last decade to calculate the fair ration.\n",

Also if exports are increased then is it ok to have same imports or the ratio at which we doing imports even after the $$ to Rupee is so high. also this can be one of the reason for our import deficit which ur showing on 4.42 . you should also do it as a rate/ration from past decade to this decade. I dont know what is the sweet spot here definitely high exports and low imports is needed. \n",

Jobs -- yes this has been a concern but this could also mean even though the industry are up or upgraded.. there is possibility that more and more automated machines have been used. take for example job cuts in IT industry due to AI and automation.

We are now exporting defence equipments, toys and food products. The point I'm trying to make is, numbers only don't tell the whole story, which is what you don't seem to understand. The problems you mentioned surely exist, but the success of Make in India can been gauged by looking at these parameters and data in a comparative manner. Surely, we are far from what we want to be, but how fast are we marching towards it, makes the difference. The changes in the logistics sector are huge, partly due to the infrastructure, GST, e-way bills. Waterways, if successful, will be a huge boost and we are seeing that happening with the nu.ber of ports the govt want to develop.

      "Terrible Roads, Terrible Lives: Why Poor Infrastructure Drains More Than Just Our Patience\n",
      "If you’re a part of the daily grind in India, you know the agony of our roads. Terrible, potholed streets aren’t just an inconvenience; they represent a significant and painful issue affecting all aspects of life—energy, time, health, and even the environment. It's a daily battle that steals hours of our time, chips away at our health, and worsens the environment we live in.\n",
      "Our roads are riddled with pits, dust clouds, and constant congestion. Every journey becomes a test of patience and endurance, a drawn-out affair that saps us before we even begin our days. Imagine spending hours choking on exhaust fumes, bracing for sudden bumps, and wasting countless minutes trying to inch forward—all this on routes we must take every single day. It’s draining, both physically and mentally, and it doesn’t just wear down our cars; it wears us down too.\n",
      "How Bad Roads Shape a Strained Society\n",
      "Poor infrastructure doesn’t just harm individuals; it harms the community. People are stressed and irritable, short on time, and tired even before reaching their workplaces, schools, or markets. The impact of this goes far beyond inconvenience—it influences productivity, mental well-being, and even relationships. People who spend hours in traffic every day are bound to feel more frustrated, less optimistic, and physically exhausted, creating a society less connected, more isolated, and often frustrated.\n",
      "The frustration also affects how we interact. People stuck in traffic jams or navigating potholes are often less inclined to show patience or understanding, contributing to a societal attitude that’s more about surviving the commute than thriving within a community.\n",
      "Environmental and Health Impact\n",
      "When cars crawl bumper to bumper on dusty, congested roads, they release far more pollutants than they would on smoother, faster routes. Not only does this worsen air quality, but it also contributes to increased fuel consumption and higher emissions, accelerating environmental degradation. Dust from broken roads fills the air, affecting our lungs, especially those of children and the elderly. And let’s not forget the noise pollution, a constant backdrop of honking and revving engines that adds yet another layer of stress.\n",

      "The \"Make in India\" initiative, launched with the aim of turning India into a global manufacturing hub, has faced numerous significant challenges and is widely seen as having fallen short of its ambitious goals. Below are various ways in which the initiative has struggled, with many viewing it as more of a political slogan than a functional strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Unrealistic Manufacturing Targets\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial Target: The initiative aimed to increase the manufacturing sector's share of GDP to 25% by 2022 from about 16% in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: As of recent years, the manufacturing sector has barely crossed the 17% mark, far short of the target. With a lack of structural reforms and coherent planning, this goal was likely unachievable from the start.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lack of Infrastructure Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: Manufacturing requires strong infrastructure, including reliable power, transport, and logistics networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: Infrastructure bottlenecks have persisted, with delayed projects, inadequate facilities, and power supply issues that drive up costs and make Indian manufacturing less competitive globally. For instance, logistics costs in India are about 14% of GDP, much higher than global benchmarks of 8-9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Complex Regulatory Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "Bureaucratic Red Tape: Although the government promoted \"ease of doing business,\" many regulatory processes remained complex, lengthy, and inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Reforms: Essential reforms needed to streamline business approvals, land acquisition, and labor laws were either delayed or implemented in a way that was insufficient to attract major foreign investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Failure to Attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Manufacturing\n",
      "\n",
      "High Expectations: The initiative hoped to bring in significant foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortfall: While FDI has increased in service sectors, manufacturing FDI has lagged due to concerns about poor infrastructure, regulatory unpredictability, and high labor costs. Many international companies chose countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh over India due to more favorable conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Lack of Skill Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Issue: The \"Make in India\" initiative required a skilled workforce capable of meeting the demands of advanced manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: India's vocational training and skill development programs have not been able to keep pace with industry demands. This has resulted in a skills gap, forcing companies to either compromise on quality or look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Dependence on Imports\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenge: To manufacture goods domestically, the Indian industry needs access to quality raw materials and components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: India has continued to rely heavily on imports for critical raw materials, machinery, and components, especially from China, undercutting the core aim of the initiative to reduce imports and increase self-sufficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Inadequate Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Role of SMEs: SMEs are critical to any manufacturing ecosystem, but many Indian SMEs lack access to credit, technology, and infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Without adequate support and funding, SMEs have struggled to contribute meaningfully to the \"Make in India\" mission. Bureaucratic hurdles and delayed payments further exacerbate their problems, leading to high mortality rates among SMEs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. High Operating Costs and Lack of Competitive Edge\n",
      "\n",
      "Operating Costs: Energy, labor, and logistics costs in India are significantly higher compared to countries like China and Vietnam, making Indian goods less competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Indian manufacturing struggles to compete on the global stage, with \"Make in India\" unable to address the core cost and efficiency issues that deter international buyers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Limited Success in Job Creation\n",
      "\n",
      "Goal: The initiative intended to create millions of new jobs, especially in manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality: Job creation has remained weak, with a limited increase in manufacturing jobs and a large portion of employment still concentrated in the informal sector. This failure is a direct consequence of the slow growth of manufacturing and structural issues in job-intensive sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10. COVID-19 and Global Supply Chain Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact: The pandemic disrupted global supply chains, impacting production and investment flows worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outcome: The \"Make in India\" initiative’s slow progress left India less prepared to pivot quickly during these disruptions, and the country lost additional ground to competitors in terms of manufacturing resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Perception as a Political Slogan\n",
      "\n",
      "Criticism: Many have argued that \"Make in India\" was more of a political slogan than a well-thought-out policy, designed primarily to appeal to voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Result: Without substantial policy support or systemic reforms to back it up, the initiative has seen limited results, leading to skepticism about its true intent and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Make in India\" initiative’s failures stem from a mix of ambitious but unrealistic targets, a complex business environment, and a lack of deep-rooted reforms in infrastructure, labor, and skill development. These factors have kept India’s manufacturing sector from realizing its potential, and until structural changes are made, the initiative may remain more a symbol of aspiration than actual progress.  -----  Criticism\n",

      "That's where Vietnam is racing ahead of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many countries and blocs which India enjoys trade surplus don't have FTAs in Place.\n",
      "Best examples are US, EU, UK.\n",
      "If we exclude Energy purchases like Oil and Gas since we are net energy importers we don't have FTAs with high per capita income markets like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman etc whcih are oil rich.\n",
      "Once FTAs are in place tariffs on Indian goods will be reduced which can increase competitiveness of the Indian products overall this can contribute a lot to Ease of Doing Business.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I still believe the way Make in India changed the approach of policy making towards manufacturing as a whole.\n",
      "Unlike the focus on traditional sectors like textiles and other industries the focus went to bring higher manufacturing sectors like Electronics, Speciality Steel, Li ion Battery cells, Solar modules and cells however wafers and polysilicon should be next area of focus, semiconductors atleast of matured grade etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even in electronics gross value addition per device is around 15-20% which is good enough considering that we started assembly of devices in a large scale post 2013 time period.\n",
      "This might soon reach to 30% before 2030.\n",
      "In comparison at present China's value addition itself in electronics is 45%.\n",
      "\n",
      "I call Make in India a partial failure considering the fact that manufacturing push im new age sectors was not there before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor for less manufacturing growth is the Private GFCF in India which was due to the negative credit cycle in India which saw a wave of bankruptcies and piling up of NPAs which made lending institutions too cautious about giving out credit.\n",
      "This resulted in low capex from Private sector right from 2012 itself which is not yet reached it's 2006-10 cycle peak as % of GDP.\n",
      "But situation seems to be changing now corporate balance sheet is strengthened due to less debt, less NPA and provisioning from banks.\n",
      "Private sector capex should pickup which can lead to a capacity expansion due to more number of manufacturing SMEs being onboarded by big industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even on infrastructure front core projects are nearing completion like Transhipment port in Vizhinjam, Multiple Expressways like Bengaluru-Chennai Delhi-Mumbai Nagpur-Mumbai, Western and Eastern DFC etc which connect hinterlands to ports.\n",

You have compared China's growth with India, as belittling as speed of the goods train. You have selectively cut and pasted the interviews and news items of many of the hallowed persons. I need to answer your slurry. In 70’s, USA with her President Nixon and the Aide Henry Kissinger embarked to China who they have considered China as a possible ally to break the hold of USSR from the world order. The MNCs looking for instant profit fell into the trap of Mao Ze Dong and opened their manufacturing bases. In business there is no Capitalism or Communism, only the haves and have-nots. The great Steve Jobs visited India and he chose China over India. Elon Musk started his Tesla in Shanghai with a clear understanding that the technology transfer is for Chinese only. They as usual, stripped his technology and made BYD as the arch rival to Tesla. He has not flown his Space X from China.

Ratan Tata himself had said that when Tata Nano wanted to shift their project from Singur, Bengal to Sanand Gujarat in 2008, the then Chief Minister Modi met him on the land allocated to Nano Project with red carpet. That type of instant decisions are possible, though it cannot be a rule.  Make in India may not be grand success as many variables have chipped in after the announcement of that Program. Covid, Slow-down of world economy, Constant bickering at the border with the neighbouring countries exacerbated by anti-Indian activity by the so-called Leftists and Intellectuals to cite a few. Even with all the shortcomings it is taking shape. Even for a totalitarian country like China, it has taken many decades with a lot of help from USA. You can follow the link https://www.pppinindia.gov.in/list_of_all_ppp_projects where as many as 1583 projects with an outlay of nearly Rs.25 lakh crores been invested. Many projects may be under Make in India scheme. India, time immemorial is an Agriculture based economy like China. When the transition came China, due to its stroke of luck became a manufacturing economy. India straightway became a service economy thanks to technological boom in the West and more English-speaking employees available in our Country. Now we are taking a step backward to integrate manufacturing into services with lot of hiccups.  Two or three decades is merely a blip in a country’s growth. I expect a pat for the development of our country showing the highlights of various achievements. Every goal always be not perfect. Graphs and Histograms do not reveal the true nature of economy.
